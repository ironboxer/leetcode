### Binary Search


```Python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses, heaters):
        heaters = sorted(heaters) + [float('inf')]
        i = r = 0
        for x in sorted(houses):
            while x >= sum(heaters[i:i + 2]) / 2:
                i += 1
            r = max(r, abs(heaters[i] - x))

        return r

```

二分查找法

```Python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses, heaters):
        from bisect import bisect_right
        heaters.sort()
        i = r = 0
        for x in houses:
            pos = bisect_right(heaters, x)
            pos = max(pos, 0)
            pos = min(pos, len(heaterss) - 1)
            r = max(r, abs(heaters[pos] - x))

        return r
```
