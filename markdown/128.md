### [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)


```Python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        s = set(nums)
        best = 0
        for i in s:
            if i - 1 not in s:
                j = i + 1
                while j in s:
                    j += 1
                best = max(best, j-i)
                
        return best

```

思路很清晰


```Python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        s = set(nums)
        for n in nums:
            if n - 1 not in s:
                j = n + 1
                while j in s:
                    j += 1
                res = max(res, j - n)
        return res

```

非常巧妙
